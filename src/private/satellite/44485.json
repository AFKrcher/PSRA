      "descriptionLong": "The AeroCube-10a spacecraft has two payloads. The first is a dispenser with a magazine of 29 identical atmospheric probes. Each probe weighs 16 grams and consist of three 98 mm diameter aluminum sheets at 90 degrees to each other, effectively forming a sphere. The intent is to be lightweight and have a constant cross section, independent of orientation to the velocity direction so that atmospheric drag can be measured in-situ. RF modeling predicts that the atmospheric probes will have a radar cross section equal to 1U CubeSats, which have been tracked on-orbit many times. The probes are dispensed individually upon command and it is predicted that each has a lifetime of 0.74 years when deployed from the highest altitude of 500 km. The second payload is an optical beacon. It is used to verify that the AeroCube-10a satellite is indeed pointing at the AeroCube-10b. It consists of a 4 W laser diode with a 1Â° full-width-half-max beam divergence."
